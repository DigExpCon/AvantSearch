# AvantSearch

The AvantSearch plugin provides extended search results capabilities for the public interface. User documentation describing this plugin's extensive functionality is located in the Digital Archive topic [Searching the Digital Archive](http://swhplibrary.net/searching/).
 
At this time, the AvantSearch implementation is specific to the Southwest Harbor Public Library's [Digital Archive](http://swhplibrary.net/archive) and therefore **this plugin is not usable as-is for an Omeka installation**. However, the source code is provided here for the benefit of software developers who want to learn about the logic or adapt it for use on another project.

This plugin was developed for the [Southwest Harbor Public Library](http://www.swhplibrary.org/), in Southwest Harbor, Maine. Funding was provided in part by the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).
