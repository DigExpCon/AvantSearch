<ul>
    <li><b>Years</b><br>For an open-ended year range such as <i>from</i> 1900 or <i>until</i> 1970, leave either Start or End blank.
    Items that use a year range as their Date, for example "1861-1865," will only be searched based on the first year in the range.
    Thus, a search for items in the range 1864 to 1865 will not find the example item.</li>
